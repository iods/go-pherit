Go-Pherit
=========

An evolving web application, REST, GCP, etc. SDK for my Go projects.

Code golf by caring more about the simplicity of what I am doing than how many
characters it is written with. A game I feel like Gophers writing Go would
play. In reality, it is just some projects compiled into one place, so I can
reuse the packages.
