Golang (Go.com was not available at the time lol) is a simple programming language, that compiles fast, runs fast, and is easy to distribute.
* Focuses on simplicity and speed by harnessing power of today's multi-core processors

## The Problem

Google was compiling millions of lines of code, taking hours at a time. They built a solution with Go which solved:
* Slow compilation
* Cumbersome code
* Garbage collection (freeing unused memory)
* Concurrency
* Support for multi-core processors

Robert Grieseman, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson created Go in 2007 at Google.
